# Sprint 3 Planning

### Sprint 3 Goal
For Sprint 3 we have three goals:
1. Improve the design of our website. We want to make our website more visually appealing to the user.
2. Work on Breaking News, Contact Form, FAQs.
3. Take care of the behind the scenes work (check off issues, document work better... etc).

# Sprint 3 Retrospective #
### *What Went Well*
Noah was able to add Breaking News to our webpage and it looks fantastic!
### *What Could Be Improved*
Starting work earlier, better task management/outlines.
### *What We Will Commit To Improve*
For the Final Demo:
1. Continue with the CSS of our webpages.
2. Fill in any empty pages, look to add more to the website.
3. Develop a better presentation format. We have great speakers, knowledgable individuals, we should demonstrate that better.
