    <div id = "Question1">
        <h3>Why should I use this site over ESPN.com or similiar websites?</h3>
        <p>
            Although we would like to be the sole provider for stats and news to the sports and gambling community,
			we know that our core users generally visit/use many products in this field. Our aim is to provide
			information where we see other providers in this space are lacking. As our product grows, we hope
			that the user will see our unique difference from the other websites and choose to keep us in their
			rotation of sports and gambling related products.
        </p>

    <div id = "Question2">
        <h3>Where are the betting lines? I want to place bets!</h3>
        <p>
            Breaking Bets is not a gambling website. Although our information is tailored to meet the interests of the betting community,
			we are a sports information provider. Once our team graduates, we may look into providing betting lines and more gambling centered
			features.

    <div id = "Question3">
        <h3>I want to be able to search for player or team information, how do I do that?</h3>
        <p>
            The tables that we use, provided through the generosity of Pro Football Reference, are capable of being sorted.
			If you would like to search for a specific player, you can simply click on the header of the column that displays
			player names. Once sorted, you can easily find the player you are looking for. This same method can be used for 
			team information.
        </p>

    <div id = "Question4">
        <h3>If I have an issue with the website, how do I notify the developers?</h3>
        <p>
            For any issues or concerns that you may have, we have a Contact page that can be navigated to through any of our webpages.
			The Contact button located underneath our company logo can be clicked and you will be directed to a page displaying a
			contact form. Once on the Contact page, you can fill out the form and submit it to our team. Once our team is notified
			of the issue through our email, we will happily respond and answer any of your questions and/or concerns.
        </p>

    <div id = "Question5">
        <h3>Why create a product like Breaking Bets?</h3>
        <p>
			Our team is full of sports and gambling fans, and we see an opportunity to enter these two fields. We are looking for
			ways to maximize our betting interests, fantasy team production, and overall sports entertainment experience.
			As we continue to grow, we want to share our interests and vision with other like-minded individuals which will
			allow us to grow organically and remain relevant with average fan.
