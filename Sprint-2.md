# Sprint 2 Planning

### Sprint Goal
For Sprint 2 we have two goals:
1. Improve the design of our website. We want to make our website more visually appealing to the user.
2. Solve our live stats problem.

We expect goal #2 to extend through Sprint 2 and take up most of Sprint 3.
Due to the complexity of this goal, we need to complete goal #1 promptly so that
all attention can be directed onto goal #2 and anything else that needs attention.

# Sprint Retrospective #
### *What Went Well*
The group was able to incorporate web pages from ProFootballReference that allowed us to display player and team stats
with a 24 hour delay.
### *What Could Be Improved*
Ideally, we begin designing tables using our database and fill in the "live" stats through ProFootabllReference. Using the database for
this purpose will allow us to display unique information while also implementing more of our own source code.
### *What We Will Commit To Improve*
For the final sprint we will:
1. Update the CSS of our webpages.
2. Fill in the webpages that have missing information.
3. Incorporate our database into our webpages.
4. Time management will be our top priority as we have a lot of work left to complete our project.
