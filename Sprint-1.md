# Sprint 1 Planning

### Sprint Goal
The Sprint 1 Goal is to design and develop a working website
that will serve as our starting point for Sprint 2.
The website should resemble our vision for what the finished
product will look like during Demo 3.

# Sprint Retrospective #
### *What Went Well*
The group worked well as a team, completing our first Sprint Planning while also managing our lab assignments.
Although we were unhappy with our first Sprint Review (demo), this allowed us to determine areas for improvement.
### *What Could Be Improved*
Time management should be a priority so that we meet our Sprint 2 goals.
More attention to pre-planning should be addressed as well.
### *What We Will Commit To Improve*
We will work on improving our time management and focus in four ways:
1. Each task in the sprint log will be thoroughly discussed as a group, allowing members to focus their work on a well defined task.
2. The Group Task Schedule will be made shareable so that members can see where the group currently stands with sprint tasks.
Members will be able to offer help on tasks that they see falling behind.
3. Members will strive to maintain their expected project work schedules.
4. Communication will be improved, and the group will have a weekly goal to focus on.
